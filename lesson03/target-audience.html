            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>
                Target audience is regular people like you and me, whose daily lives could use a bit more convenience
                and flexibility thanks to the insights provided by Climatize.
            </p>
            <h3>Persona 1</h3>
            <p>
                A stay-at-home parent who needs to know how to balance the multiple activities of their daily, hectic life.
            </p>
            <h3>Persona 2</h3>
            <p>
                A working adult, who takes public transportation to and from work, and walks large distances each day.
            </p>
            <h3>Scenario 1</h3>
            <p>
                A stay-at-home mom is planning her morning: dropping kids off at school, go grocery shopping, and return home for chores.
                She's had multiple experiences with the ever-changing climate in Utah, and knows that the weather might not be the same
                when she leaves home than when she returns later that morning. She visits Climateize to know which roads are best to drive
                after last night's rain storm, and whether there is a chance that it might rain while she's out and about.
            </p>
            <h3>Scenario 2</h3>
            <p>
                A recent college graduate wants to arrive early and tidy on her first day at work, and does not know whether she will be
                able to walk after she gets off the frontrunner. If she learns from Climateize that it will continue to snow as it did the previous morning,
                she might have to take an Uber once she gets off the public transportation.
            </p>
            <h3>Scenario 3</h3>
            <p>
                A working dad has an event after work late at night, and needs to learn on Climateize whether the evening will be too cold for the clothes
                he usually wears on a normal day.
            </p>
            <h3>Scenario 4</h3>
            <p>
                A working soon-to-be-groom needs to learn about weather conditions for his upcoming wedding. He'll continue taking the bus and then walk to work to
                try to get a real-life feel for how guests will have to dress during his wedding, and uses Climateize data to see if the forecast is reliable enough
                to use for the coming week.
            </p>
            <h3>Scenario 5</h3>
            <p>
                A working, single mom needs to help her children prepare for summer camp at an area that she's unfamiliar with. She visits Climateize to take a look
                at the forecast to help her kids pack for camp.
