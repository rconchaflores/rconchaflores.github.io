            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>
                Target audience is regular people like you and me, whose daily lives could use a bit more convenience
                and flexibility thanks to the insights provided by Climatize.
            </p>
            <h3>Persona 1</h3>
            <p>
                A stay-at-home parent who needs to know how to balance the multiple activities of their daily, hectic life.
            </p>
            <h3>Persona 2</h3>
            <p>
                A working adult, who takes public transportation to and from work, and walks large distances each day.
            </p>
            <h3>Scenario 1</h3>
            <p>
                A stay-at-home mom is planning her morning: dropping kids off at school, go grocery shopping, and return home for chores.
                She's had multiple experiences with the ever-changing climate in Utah, and knows that the weather might not be the same
                when she leaves home than when she returns later that morning. She visits Climatize to know which roads are best to drive
                after last night's rain storm, and whether there is a chance that it might rain while she's out and about.
            </p>
            <h3>Scenario 2</h3>
            <p>
                A recent college graduate wants to arrive early and tidy on her first day at work, and does not know whether she will be
                able to walk after she gets off the frontrunner. If she learns from Climatize that it will continue to snow as it did the previous morning,
                she might have to take an Uber once she gets off the public transportation.
            </p>
            <h3>Scenario 3</h3>
            <p>
                A working dad has an event after work late at night, and needs to learn on Climatize whether the evening will be too cold for the clothes
                he usually wears on a normal day.
